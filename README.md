# Yelp-Restaurant-Photo-Classification
This project is to automatically tag restaurants with nine labels from a bag of images uploaded by users. We used transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models to obtain the features of each image, and followed by a neural network classifier. We achieved a F1 score of 0.743 by using VGG16 feature extractor and LSTM-based neural network classifier, which is a 0.31 increase from a random guesser baseline.
